# RoutingUpdateSample.dat
# This is the routing method update definition file. Programs that must make 
# modifications to the CJOBDR table will load and scan through the records in 
# this file to find the first matching record and use that to update the 
# routing data. Thus you should put the wildcard record definitions at the 
# end of the file. Records by customer number are expected to be mininal and
# thus are included in this file as well. Eventually we will want to optimize
# things so that customer specific records go into separate files, to improve
# processing speed and to simplify management (we might never need to go that
# far however).
#
#
# Each non-blank line must contain 1 of 2 row definitions as defined below. The condition
# row is enclosed in [ ] brackets and also acts a header record for the detail routing
# operations to be applied to that conditioin. Within a row, fields must be separated by 
# semicolons and follow the format described below.
#
# The file is read until the first matching condition record is found. Then the fields
# within that condition are loaded and applied to the part as required. Each part
# within a job is processed separately. Thus is is possible to have different conditions
# apply to the mandrel and plate of a hollow die for example. Processing stops at the 
# first matching condition (see more below re: CONTINUE ). 
#
#   Field   Description
#     1     FEATURE,OPTION: this simply needs to be a substring contained in the 
#           features and options description, any match of this string within the description
#           will be taken as a match. Thus for "MULTI - MANDREL", if the word MULTI doesn't 
#           appear in any other feature/option record, then it would be sufficient to use 
#           MULTI as the field definition. The feature and option are both tested separately
#           if you know that the option is sufficient to uniquely match the required 
#           record, then you can specify * for the feature. If there is no comma in the string
#           then it is interpreted as  *,option 
#     2     CUSTOMER: this is the solarsoft customer number, max of 8 chars. To match all 
#           customers for this record, use a '*' character (without the quotes). 
#     3     DIAM: This defines the exact diameter or range of diameters to match against 
#           the parts. To match all parts define 0-100 which means all parts between 0 
#           and 100 inches in diameter. If you want to specify the units in millimeters, 
#           then include an 'm' or 'mm' after the number (the program only looks for the first
#           m, it is not possible to specify meters here). Thus a range of 100m-200m means all
#           dies >= 99.99mm and <= 200.01mm, since there is 0.01mm tolerance factor built
#           into the value testing. To match a part excactly (within the 0.01mm tolerance) then
#           specify just a single number without a range. 
#     4     PART: this can be either *, or one or more part designation characters. The 
#           characters are mapped as follows (these are not exactly like decade but it 
#           gets rid of the confusion of 0 and O for bolsters. Also, there are extra 
#           types defined beyond what we will be using initially in anticipation of 
#           future expansion of the code set. 
#                The characters are capitalized before processing. 
#                
#                F - feeder
#                M - mandrel 
#                P - plate 
#                B - backer 
#                K - sub backer (these don't exist in the system yet)
#                L - bolster 
#                S - sub bolster 
#                R - ring 
#                I - insert (generic)
#                A - plate insert
#                C - mandrel insert
#                T - bolt. 
#
#            In the future if we need to expand the part definition set we can make parts
#            case sensitive, thus it is a good idea to define all parts capitalized. 
#
#            If a * is defined then no other parts should be included since they will
#            be ignored. 
#
#       ALL REMAINING FIELDS MUST MATCH THE RESPECTIVE DATA WITHIN THE SOLARSOFT TABLES
#        (EXCEPT FOR THE FUNCTION FIELD)
#
#     1     FUNCTION: this can be exactly one of ADD, DEL, or MOD (variations are not allowed)
#     2     SEQ#: this must match the sequence number required by solarsoft. If you are 
#           adding a new routing entry, then it is possible to define a sequence number
#           which does not exist within the standard routing definitions in table METHDR  
#     3     DEPT: department as defined in solarsoft, see 'DEPTS' table, this is the 2 letter
#           code without the plant code prefix
#     4     RESOURCE: as defined in table.field RESRE.ABRESC, 3 letter code
#     5     OPERATION: operation code as defined in OPCODE.AECODE  (3 chars)
#     6     RUN STANDARD: the number of hours required for operation as floating point number
#     7     STATUS: will always be N (this may change later)
#     8     REPORTING: always set to N unless this is supposed to be tracked at a solarsoft
#           terminal whereby the stock serial number needs to be entered (not sure about 
#           this, might have to be a Y)
#
#    Note that all the Solarsoft specific codes must be valid for the active plant. You 
#    cannot reference an OPCODE from a different plant for example since solarsoft doesn't
#    allow this. 
#  
# Condition rows are defined as follows:
#   
#    [{FEAT,}OPT  ; CUSTOMER ; DIAMETER ; PART {; CONTINUE}]
#    [!{FEAT,}OPT  ; CUSTOMER ; DIAMETER ; PART {; CONTINUE}]
#
# and the action or data record within a condition has the following format
#
#    FUNC; SEQ#; DEPT; RES; OPER; TIME; STAT; REPORT
#
#   Note it is the lead '[' character that distinguishes the two types or rows. 
#
# If the condition starts with [! then this is an inverted condition rule
# meaning that the rule will apply if the feature/option does not exist. 
# An example of this type of rule would be hardened blank, whereby the 
# hardened blank exists within the standard routing, but if the feature/option
# hardened blank does not exist, then we want to delete hardened blank 
# routing steps. 
#
# For now the RES and OPER definitions are not used in DEL commands for 
# record matching purposes. Only the sequence number and dept must match
# for the record to be deleted. 
#
# The word CONTINUE in the conditional statement row is an optional keyword, 
# only the keyword CONTINUE is recognized. If defined, then it means that this 
# is a non-terminating condition. Thus if this condition matches, then the
# contained RTE records would be processed and included for the part, but 
# instead of stopping, the program will continue to search for matching
# condition records. If CONTINUE is not defined then a matching condition 
# completes the processing (all RTE definition records in the matching 
# condition are loaded and then processing stops). 
#
# If a job has no features and options, then only the global wildcard type 
# conditions could ever match in this case. You can define multiples of 
# these so long as the type is CONTINUE and they will all be processed. 
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# To deal with special types of situations the conditions can also be 
# extended through a '[~n' type designator at the start. For now only
# a type 1 is defined and is used to allow for changing single sub part 
# routing data. For example, if an order comes in for a new plate to 
# match an existing mandrel, the sales people will enter that part 
# directly as opposed to selected the entire hollow die part (this is 
# how Markham has been operating at least). When this happens there is 
# no CAD/CAM or inpsection routing data for this part, and this now needs
# to be added. This requires a special rule. 
# 
# These rules are very simple for now and are defined as follows:
#
#    [~n; PART]
#
#  IMPORTANT: There can't be a space between ~ (tilde character) and n, 
#  it must be "~1" and not "~ 1" for example.
#
#  If we need to make the above more specific this can be added as 
#  a future extension. 
#
#  Thus if an 'HD 10 X 6 PLATE' part exists as an order item then 
#  the following rule would match
#    [~1; P]
#
#  There is an example in this file of how to modify CAD/CAM for 
#  plates, mandrels, and backers. 
#
# ====================================================================
# Actual file is show below with some possible examples commented out. 
# This is the run file being used for testing at Markham. All we are 
# really doing is deleting a bunch of operations and cleaning up the 
# nitriding. The other rules that are commented out are examples 
# used for testing only.

# ==================
# A special case rule is defined by [~ followed by a rule code or number.
# for now only rule 1 is defined, and as more are added n will be 
# incremented to designate those new rules. 
#
# n For the single sub-parts is 1 thus [~1 defines these records.

# included the backers in the same rule as the mandrel and plates in 
# this case, but to show that these can be split up we do so for this
# example.) You cannot use a wildcard character for the part, you must
# designate each part desired.

# This special case rule deals with the problem of solid dies being 
# made up of multiple components, but only being able to track a single
# part at a time through CAD/CAM, Inspection and possibly other similar
# resources in the future. For these cases, a part priority ranking system
# is used, and the CAD/CAM, etc... times are assigned exclusively to this
# part for tracking purposes. This way the time and cost is tracked for the
# overall job, even though the individual part gets distorted. This is a 
# tradeoff in dealing with Solarsoft limitations. Other solutions using weighted
# average distributions become much more difficult to implement and require 
# an exponential number of sub-resource definitions (or cause scheduler skews)
#
# This is just a straight rule that always applies in terms of how to deal with
# with non-master assembly parts. 
#
# The priority assignment is as follows
#
#        PLATE          1 
#        MANDREL        2 
#        FEEDER         3

#        SUBBOLSTER     6 
#        RING           7 
#
# Thus the first part that exists within the order in the above list will be
# left alone. All remaining parts will have the following operations performed
# Because it is a delete operation some fields are ignored but need to be defined
# so that the data loads correctly.
