# BAAL TaskMap mapping from Decade to Solarsoft
#
# lines starting with # are treated as comments and ignored. 
#
# This is a sample task code map definition file used to translate Decade task
# codes to sequence numbers within the routing steps in solarsoft. 
#
# There is a separate task map file for each of the plants so that they can 
# be maintained independently.
#
#
# There are 5 fields and one optional field as follows:
#   DECADE_TASK[-STOPTASK], DECADE_PART, MODE, CMS_OPCODE, CMS_SEQ#  [,WHERE] 
#
#   OPCODE is from  OPCODE table
#   SEQ#   is from  METHDR table
#
# The MODE field indicates the type of tracking events that are to 
# be sent to solarsoft. If mode = START, then an 10151 event is sent
# to solarsoft indicating that a machine has started working on a
# specific part. A mode of NEXT means that the machine has loaded the 
# next part and it defines that part as complete the moment that it is
# loaded onto the machine. This is to support the current method of 
# operation for those machines where the barcode tracking only occurs
# when the part is loaded onto the machine and nowhere else. This will 
# report the 40005 event early but doesn't increase the amount of 
# tracking workload for the operator. 
#
# If mode = STOP, then a 10100 event is sent to solarsoft to indicate that
# the machine has stopped working on the part. If MODE = COMPLETE
# then a 10100 event and a 40005 event is sent to solarsoft to indicate 
# the machine is done and that the part has been completed. 
#
# The final possible mode is TRACK which outputs a 40005 event code only
# so that the part production event is tracked.
#
# These can be extended as required to create special sets of data tracking.
#
#   MODE            EVENTS SENT
# =================================================
#   START           10151, 20000
#   NEXT            10151, 20000, 40005
#   STOP            20009, 10100 
#   COMPLETE        40005, 20009, 10100
#   TRACK           40005
#
# Note: The sequence 10151, 40005, 10100 must be used if the 10100 down code
# is going to be used. Attempting to do 40005 while the resource is not in 
# the run state causes an error condition, and will not report any production. 
#
# 20000 events are output along with the 10151 automatically simply to track
# the employee that has loaded/started the job. Labour rates are set to zero 
# in the system (for now at least) so will not impact the financials. 
# Similarily, a 20009 is output along with the 10100 event. 
#
# WHERE  one of {B,S,D}
#
# The optional last field WHERE indicates which system to track the event
# to. Normal processing will dump the event into decade and if valid data 
# exists within the Solarsoft setup, then it will also be sent to the Solarsoft data
# queue. If WHERE is not defined and no Solarsoft mapping exists, then no 
# error message will be output to the log file. If WHERE is defined and is set
# to either B or S (meaning output to Solarsoft), and the proper Solarsoft data
# mapping does not exist to allow tracking the event, then an error message will 
# be output to the log file. DO NOT include the square brackets [ ] around the 
# where field.
#
# An example would be as follows:
#
#    MB,*,TRACK,      X,0, D
#
# Where this is the mandrel back check procedure at Markham which has nothing
# to do with machine time. Because it will not be tracked in Solarsoft, the 
# dummy placeholders of X and 0 are used for the OPCODE and SEQ# since these
# are not used, but the fields must have something in them for the line to 
# be read correctly. 
#
# 
# The DECADE_TASK field must match to the task code defined 
# in decade. The DECADE_PART can define a specific part side, just the part
# of can be a wildcard applied to all parts. It is not possible to specify
# a range of parts. Thus for example you could have for the mandrel front and
# back milling and check operations:
#
#    NC,MF,START,    CM, 60
#    MC,MF,COMPLETE, CM, 60
#    NC,MB,START,    CM, 70
#    MB,MB,COMPLETE, CM, 70
#
#
# The manual mandrel milling operations might look like
#
#    MM,M,TRACK,     MM, 80
#
# Where in the above sample the manual mill simply tracks the completion 
# of the operation with a 40005 event and doesn't require a machine run
# time for the part. A machine run time for the part could be defined in 
# this case, but then the person doing the manual mill operation would 
# have to track when they start the job and when they complete the job. 
# 
# Notice also that only an M is used as the part designator. The program 
# will attempt to match the most specific TASK,PART combination when there
# are multiple tasks for the same part. You shouldn't define two taskmap
# records with the same level of detail that would map to the same thing
# since in this case there is no way to guarantee which one will get 
# processed. 
# To specify a wildcard part use * as the part designator, as in this
# example: 
#
#   IC,*,TRACK,     INS, 180
#
# For some operations the SEQ# might vary for different part types. In 
# this situation you should enter 0 for the sequence number, which will
# force the system to do a SEQ# lookup based on the OPCODE definition. 
# This will only work if the OPCODE and the DEPT code make a unique pair
# for the operation so that only a single sequence number matches. 
# Keep in mind this will put a greater load on the DB server, so try
# to define as few SEQ#'s as possible with a value of 0. Also keep in 
# mind that the DEPT code used in the lookup is taken from the 
# station mapping reference derived from the StationMap.txt file. So if
# the seq# is 0 and the station map data is not unique or is invalid, then 
# the data sent to Solarsoft will most likely be invalid and thus will not
# be accepted by the Solarsoft system. 
# 
# If you want to see the runtime data within the Decade d_task table 
# then a secondary stop task has to be matched to the start task in 
# order to do the time delta calculation. In this case you need to 
# define the matching Runtime Termination task by adding a dash and then 
# the matching task after the initial task. Thus any task that will have 
# a matching RUNTIME type record must be in the form:
#   
#    ST-ET,DECADE_PART,START,  CMS_OPCODE, CMS_SEQ#  [,WHERE] 
#
# Note that the task processing mode must be START in this case, and the 
# second task will automatically be interpreted as the COMPLETE task
# So for example, say the wire department is using W0 and W1 as the start
# and stop tasks and W1 is used as the RUNTIME record stop task. Then 
# the following would might be defined:
#
#    W1-W0,P,START,  WIR, 260, S
#
# which would handle W1 start times and W0 as stop times and would only
# be tracked in Solarsoft.
