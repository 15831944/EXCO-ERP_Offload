#    The structure of the timing records file is a text file where each line in the 
#    file defines one mapping definition. Lines starting with # are ignored. 
#    The format of the lines read must be as follows:
#    
#        SEQ#;PART;DEPT;RES;PREFIX[,PREF2,PREF3...];SUFFIX[,SUFF2,SUFF3,...];NDIGITS
#    
#    For a record that defines how to process a wire edm process in the Markham 
#    plant, for example, a valid line might look like:
#    
#    152;P;WI;*;WX;;5
#    
#    The '*' character in the RES position means that we can ignore the resource
#    when matching the record within Solarsoft. For now the RES field must always
#    be * since it is ignored in the logic, it is simply defined, in case we need 
#    to added another level of detail, so that the parameter file does not have 
#    to be completely changed. Only those records requiring additional detail 
#    will need the * changed to an actual resource string. 
#    
#    The PART designator indicates the type of part that we are talking about. The
#    part mapping characters are the same as those defined in RoutingCondRec
#    
#        F - feeder
#        M - mandrel 
#        P - plate 
#        B - backer 
#        K - sub backer
#        L - bolster 
#        S - sub bolster 
#        R - ring 
#        I - insert (generic)
#        A - plate insert
#        C - mandrel insert
#        T - bolt. 
#    
#    Again these should always be defined uppercase, as we may need to introduce 
#    more part conditions in the future and then case may be important. The reason
#    part must be defined is because in Markham's methods for example, SEQ# can be
#    used to plate or mandrel milling so there is no way to separate the two 
#    without this extra character definition. 
#    
#    You can also substitute a '*' (without the quotes) in the DEPT field which 
#    means that only the Sequence number needs to match in this case. If the 
#    method data is set up cleanly then the sequence number should be all that 
#    is required to uniquely identify an operation, but the Markham plant for 
#    example is not setup this way. 
#    
#    During processing, for each METHDR entry this map file is scanned to grab 
#    all matching pattern records. 
#    
#    The UG runtime files must have the following format:
#    
#    AAn...n[.txt]
#    n...nAA[.txt]
#    
#    
#    The n...n matches the order number for the job, and based on a runtime parameter
#    the program will try to match up to NDIGITS=k trailing digits. Thus if the trailing
#    digits parameter is 5 and the order number is 214702, then when the directory 
#    is searched, for a prefix of WX with 5 digits, the search string would be 
#    'WX14702*' where only the trailing 5 sigits are used. If K=0, then the string
#    would be 'WX214702*' (note that the file extension and trailing characters are
#    always ignored because a trailing * is always added to the search string.)
#   
#    The trailing digits parameter works together with the global NDIGITS parameter 
#    defined in the CADUpdate.cfg file. The CADUpdate.cfg is the master control 
#    and behaves as follows:
#
#      1) A search is done for all files matching the pattern
#                  TIMEDIR\*ORDNUM*
#          where TIMEDIR is define in CADUpdate.cfg and ORDNUM is 
#          the trailing NDIGITS (defined in CADUpdate.cfg) of the sales order 
#          number. 
#
#      2) For each prefix and suffix entry if the pattern matches any of the 
#         filenames returned in (1) above, that time is added to the total 
#         for the job. 
#
#    
#    Also there can be multiple suffix or prefix definitions, which will be combined
#    for the total time required. 
#    
#    In Markham for example, the mandrel back operation can be split across multiple 
#    programs in certain cases. These are all defined by the same sequence number in 
#    the method however. Thus multiple operations must be summed together to get the 
#    time for the actual sequence number. 
#    
#    NOTE: You can only define a suffix and a prefix. If both are defined
#    the times for all matches will be added together. 
#    
#    For a search pattern of suffix WX and K=5 the string would be '14702WX*' and 
#    so on. 
#
#   NOTE: 
#      1) The overall sum of times from all time files must be positive otherwise
#         the value is ignored. You could have a negative number so long as there 
#         is a larger positive number to make the overall result positive.
#      2) The prefix and suffix comparisons are NOT case sensitive. Everything
#         is converted to uppercase when making the comparison
#
