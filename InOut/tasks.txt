   The parameters are as follows:
   -k Is the 2 character task code for that particular station
   -i the X=I represents a login op, O=logout, B=simultaneous login/out
   -s and -p must occur together or -S (or -T) alone must appear. If -s and -p
      then the s parameter is the shop order number (digits only) and the -p is
      the part designator 2 character code. The -S parameter is intended for
      use when jobs are downloaded to NC machines and the file name (MF12345
      for example) determines the part code automatically. In the case of the
      -S parameter the part code will be automatically generated based on the
      two letters in the file name. Also an extension string can appear on the
      end of the string which gets split off into a separate parameter.
   -L lathe mode part mapping, shop order before part code.
      (for lathe jobs)
   -W wire mode part mapping, the taskcode will be set to WE, to override the
      WE taskcode, make sure the -k parameter appears after the -W parameter
      Note: for chike, relief, electrode, and gauge types, no override is
      is possible, thus the -k parameter will have no effect
   -a is a 4 character station code. This is used to distinguish what piece
      of shop hardware the job is being run on (ZPS1, ZPS2, ... for example)
   -e is the employee code
   -d is the output directory where the one line file will be written
      do not include a trailing \ on the output directory string
   -t is the name of the server where the time will be retrieved from
      The leading \\ will automatically be put in front of the name.
   -T is the expected format of the date and time, from the time server
        where  1=YMD 2=MDY 3=DMY.
  The format of the line output looks like this:
      TASK|SONUM|EMPNUM|TKPC|MM/DD/YYYY|SCOD
    where SCOD is the station code, X is the log in/out type, PC=part code
    and TK=task code
    the TKPC must be a 4 character string.
